üó≥Ô∏è Smart Voting System  
This project is an intelligent voting system designed to modernize and secure traditional election processes. It leverages facial recognition to provide a reliable, efficient, and transparent voting experience. The system authenticates voters, records their votes securely, and automates the vote counting process to ensure accuracy and prevent fraud.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used  
The Smart Voting System is built using the following core technologies:

Python: The primary programming language for the entire system.

OpenCV-Python: Utilized for real-time facial recognition and image processing to authenticate voters.

Scikit-learn: Employed for machine learning-based voter authentication and fraud detection.

Pywin32: Used for Windows automation, likely for managing system interactions.

üöÄ Installation & Setup

Clone the Repository  

Use Git to clone the project to your local machine:  

Bash  

git clone https://github.com/Guruprashad-17/Smart_VotingSystem.git
cd Smart_VotingSystem
Install Required Libraries

The project's dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. Install them using pip:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the System

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the main scripts to operate the system. The repository contains scripts like add_faces.py and give_vote.py, which are likely used to register voters and conduct the voting process, respectively.
